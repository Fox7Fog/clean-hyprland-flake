# NixOS Clean Hyprland Flake

This repo contains one of my many personal experiments with a NixOS setup. This one specfically is meant to avoid the usual GNOME and KDE dependencies. I've been trying to see how far I can get with a cleaner system that avoids all that bloat.

## What's this all about?

I'm building around Hyprland mixed with some other independent elements. Since Hyprland at the moment doesn't come with the same system utilities that available in DEs, as usual for all window managers and wayland compositors, I will try to select independent tools to fill the gaps.

## WARNING!!! ⚠️

This is a personal experiment - something I like to hack on during weekends and evenings. It absolutely isn't meant for production use!

## Current state

The flake is functional enough for my daily tinkering, but with some caveats. I'm constantly tweaking things as I find better tools or configurations that keep the system lean while still being usable, stable and secure.

## Why avoid GNOME and KDE?

Mostly just to see if I can! I love OpenBSD and their philosophy, even though it's possible to get a very lean system doing this on Gentoo (IMO, this is what makes Gentoo great), but NixOS's declarative approach is also great and very satisfying.

Feel free to open issues with suggestions for lightweight tools that might fit this philosophy!
